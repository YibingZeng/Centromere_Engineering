**Reshaping the Maize Karyotype Using Synthetic Centromeres**


This repository contains data, code, and resources supporting the paper "Reshaping the maize karyotype using synthetic centromeres" by Yibing Zeng et al. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering functional synthetic centromeres in maize and their accurate segregation throughout plant development, including meiosis. By tethering the key centromere protein CENP-A/CENH3 to synthetic repeat sequences, we generated neochromosomes derived from chromosome 4 and characterized their structural and functional stability. Notably, we recovered and analyzed a truncated 4a chromosome paired with a complementing 4b neochromosome, which, when homozygous, supports normal plant growth, meiosis, and gene expression. This work establishes a foundation for centromere engineering to reshape plant karyotypes and accelerate artificial chromosome development. The repository includes sequencing data, methylation and gene expression analyses, and all custom scripts used in this study.

** Key highlights && Repository Structure:**

1. The primary contigs of ABS4 inbred assembly is generated by hifiasm with -l 0 parameter.
   
2. Misannotation and over-scaffold are resolved by custom-scripts under assembly folder.

3. Gene annotation is performed by Liftoff used A188 as a guide.

4. TE annotation is performed by EDTA.
   
5. The annotation of ABS and pACH25 are done by blastn.  

6. The visualization here used Karyotype package in R. The visualization in the main figure used customize script under mapping folder.

Low coverage illumina sequencing is used to estimate the polidy of chromosome 4 by following work flow:

step1: bwa index the W22 and mapped illumina seq to it;

step2: bedtools makewindows generated 100kb window; 

step3: bedtools intersect -c calculate the read count for each bin;

step4: The polidy estimation is done R by: mutate(ploidy = 2 * (count / sum(count)) * length(count))

step5: Visualized it in R using ggplot2 with each dot represents an estimation of ploidy at 100kb window.


*Characterization of neochromosomes via CUT&Tag, RNA-seq, and EM-seq.

1. Cut & Tag Pipeline:
   
step1: bwa index the ABS4 inbred assembly and mapped illumina seq to it;

step2: bedtools makewindows generated 10kb window (Smaller bins help to see if CENH3 goes over gene); 

step3: bedtools intersect -c calculate the read count for each bin;

step4: The visualization is done by customize R script enabling color-blinding selection.

2. RNA-seq Pipeline:

step1: Star index the ABS4 inbred assembly and mapped illumina seq to it;

step2: featurecount is used to calculate the read count for each exon 

step3: Gene read count is sum in R and DESeq is used to perform fold change, RLEs and DEG analysis.

step4: The visualization is done by customize R script.


3. EM-seq:

step1: Star index the ABS4 inbred assembly and mapped illumina seq to it;

step2: featurecount is used to calculate the read count for each exon 

step3: Gene read count is sum in R and DESeq is used to perform fold change, RLEs and DEG analysis.

step4: The visualization is done by customize R script.
