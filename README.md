**Reshaping the Maize Karyotype Using Synthetic Centromeres**


This repository contains data, code, and resources supporting the paper "Reshaping the maize karyotype using synthetic centromeres" by Yibing Zeng et al. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering functional synthetic centromeres in maize and their accurate segregation throughout plant development, including meiosis. By tethering the key centromere protein CENP-A/CENH3 to synthetic repeat sequences, we generated neochromosomes derived from chromosome 4 and characterized their structural and functional stability. Notably, we recovered and analyzed a truncated 4a chromosome paired with a complementing 4b neochromosome, which, when homozygous, supports normal plant growth, meiosis, and gene expression. This work establishes a foundation for centromere engineering to reshape plant karyotypes and accelerate artificial chromosome development. The repository includes sequencing data, methylation and gene expression analyses, and all custom scripts used in this study.
